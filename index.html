			<p class="grid-item item-2">Hi! I'm Sharon. I have been providing mobile 
										massage therapy for quite some time now. I am
										locally based in Winter Springs and I provide 
										several different techniques that are sure to 
										meet your unique therapudic needs. Consultation
										is free! All I ask is that we clearly communicate
										exactly what it is that we are trying to achieve.
										With this in mind I know that we can come up with a 
										solution that will alleviate what ails you. So, Give
										me a call, email me or fill out the form provided and
										I will look forward to speaking with you very soon.
										Be good to yourself in the mean time and God bless you all.

			<p class="grid-item item-4">I have extensive knowledge and experience and
										would love to share them with you. It is now 
										proven that touch leads to healing and relaxation
										leads to spiritual awakening along with meditation.
										The body is equipped to heal itself but we can faciltate that 
										process through massage. Also, I am well trained in
										all the tried and true as well as new safety protocols
										that are an absolute must in these times.

					Well trained and highly experienced and accredited! I went
					to massage therapy training at Seminole College in 2006 and 
					fell in love with it. I have a strong desire to help people
					through finding out about what is physically bothering them,
					structuring a plan of therapy and implementing that plan 
					on a regular to semi-regular basis.

		    <p class="grid-item item-7">	This is a very stressful time for us all and 
											I believe we are here for each other. As we 
											wait in expectation it is only natural for our
											bodies to hold on to tension. Let me help 
											relieve some of that with hot stone therapy!!
